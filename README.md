### Hi There! I'm Zong Han!

My projects are primarily centered around backend and networking technologies that I want to explore, but I inevitably am required to dabble in some front-end (React and Vanilla JS).

Most of my personal projects are some form of technology demonstrators, so they are quick and dirty prototypes.

I'm currently studying in NUS, but I'll be graduating soon!
